# Definitions

Based off, but heavily modified: https://gist.github.com/alexwlchan/b4554a6703e1be914a6b

This is a cli definitions manager. Start fresh by deleting `definitions.json`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bryanwtan/definitions.git
```

For easy access from any directory, create an alias In `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc:

```bash
alias def='~/<path-to-repo>/definitions.py -l'
```

Example:
